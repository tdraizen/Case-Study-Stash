## OVERVIEW ## 
 STASH FINANCIAL, INC dba STASH INVEST was founded on Feb 19th, 2015 by Brandon Krieg and Eddie Robinson.

 ## THE IDEA ##
 ##### 	How did the idea for the company come about? Both co-founders Brandon Krieg and Eddie Robinson worked together at Macquarie (Australian Investment Bank).  After a few years working together running the electronic trading platform from the bank, they both independently fielded questions from family and friends that were not in finance about which stocks to buy and when to sell, questions about money and the overall financial markets.  Essentially, these people did not have anyone to turn to, as Brandon stated, they became obsessed with the idea and both resigned within a few weeks to start a new company.  According to a Forbes article, they spent months asking people on the street about money, investing and saving.  The questions were simple, "do you invest, and do you save?" and almost every single time, they would hear the same thing, “No, I don’t invest but really want to.  I just don’t understand it.  It’s really confusing to me, so I’ll do it later.  That was the key phrase for the dynamic duo, the majority of every day Americans are not financially literate, and they wanted to solve this problem.
